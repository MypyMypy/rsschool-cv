### Code Examples:

#### LeetCode Task: 2725. Interval Cancellation

**Description:**

Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelT ms.

**My solution:**

```
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @param {Array} args
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {Function}
 */

var cancellable = function (fn, args, t) {
    fn(...args);
    const interval = setInterval(() => fn(...args), t)
    return () => clearTimeout(interval)
};
```
